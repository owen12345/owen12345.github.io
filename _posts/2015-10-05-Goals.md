I choose to build a 3D atlas because I wanted to create something with real-world value that would challenge my programming experience and yet be achievable. Another chief advantage of building an atlas is that the project as a whole is highly modularâ€”I can add 2 statistics or 200. Besides basic geography, some initial figures I hope to add are population, both by country and geographic density, energy consumption, production, and imports/exports, economic productivity, food production, major national industries, tectonic plate positioning, land type (agriculture, wilderness, urban), biodiversity, resource exploitation, and weather.  When not limited to a sheet of physical paper, there are many fascinating ways to visualize the world, such as earth bulging out by the population density. With a digital atlas, you can scroll between the most current real time data and the same statistic from thousands of years ago.
