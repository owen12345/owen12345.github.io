ROTATING METHODS:
The first technical aspect we decided to build into Atlas was earth rotation. In an effort to have the most efficient, intuitive rotation, we tested out a number of different techniques. The first was simplest—when the mouse is clicked, the earth rotates in the direction of mouse movement. However, the fact that the mouse was not tied to any one point on the earth made the movement awkward. We experimented with keeping the earth steady but rotating the camera when prompted with mouse movement. This yielded no change, with the rotation still feeling unnatural. After playing around with Google Earth, it became aware to us that in order to rotate smoothly, the mouse need to grab a specific point on the earth and move the point to another position in virtual space. The basic idea of this is to capture the grabbed point, while the mouse is clicked, using `getTouchedPoint()`. Our target position, which is also needed, is captured using the `getTouchedPoint()` function after the mouse is initially clicked. And now, using a built-in rotation function (`Quaternion.FromToRotation()`), the grabbed point will move to the position of the target point. We soon wrote the C# code below and the rotation was vastly improved. 

```c#
using UnityEngine; 
using System.Collections;  


public class DragAndRotateEarth : MonoBehaviour { 
	
	
	bool hasGrabbedPoint = false;
	Vector3 grabbedPoint;

	void Start () {

	}

	void Update () {

		if (Input.GetMouseButton (0)) { 
			if (!hasGrabbedPoint) { 
				hasGrabbedPoint = true; 
				grabbedPoint = getTouchedPoint (); 
			} else { 
				Vector3 targetPoint = getTouchedPoint ();
				if (targetPoint == Vector3.zero){
					print (targetPoint);
				} else {
					Quaternion rot = Quaternion.FromToRotation (grabbedPoint, targetPoint); 
					transform.rotation *= rot;
				}
			} 
		} else { 
			hasGrabbedPoint = false; 
		}
	}
	
	
	Vector3 getTouchedPoint() { 
		RaycastHit hit; 

		Physics.Raycast (Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition), out hit);
		
		
		return transform.InverseTransformPoint(hit.point);
		
	} 
} 
```

However, there was still one problem—it was extremely difficult to rotate around the Z-axis. In order to distinguish our rotation intentions to the computer, we created a system where the earth purely rotates on the Z-axis while clicked off the earth. To do this, a ray is sent out from the center of the earth to the coordinates of the mouse. If the ray has to exit earth in order to reach the mouse, showing that the mouse is in space, the user is granted the ability to rotate around the Z-axis. 

```c#
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class EarthBehavior : MonoBehaviour {

	private float _sensitivity;
	private Vector3 _mouseReference;
	private Vector3 _mouseOffset;
	private Vector3 _rotation;
	private bool _isRotating;

	private Vector3 pastPos;
	private Vector3 currentPos;
	
	void Start () {
		_sensitivity = 0.4f;
		_rotation = Vector3.zero;
	}

	void Update () {


		if (Input.GetButton ("Fire1")) {
			RaycastHit hit = new RaycastHit ();        
			Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay (Input.mousePosition);

			if (!Physics.Raycast (ray, out hit)) {
				if (_isRotating) {
					currentPos = Input.mousePosition;
					pastPos.x = pastPos.x - Screen.width / 2;
					pastPos.y = pastPos.y - Screen.height / 2; 
					currentPos.x = currentPos.x - Screen.width / 2;
					currentPos.y = currentPos.y - Screen.height / 2;
					float angle = Vector3.Angle (pastPos, currentPos);
					Vector3 cross = Vector3.Cross (pastPos, currentPos);
					
					//finds if obtuse angle
					if (cross.z < 0) {
						angle = 360 - angle;
					} 
					
					// apply rotation
					_rotation.z = angle;
					
					// rotate 
					transform.Rotate (_rotation, Space.World);
					
					// store mouse
					pastPos = Input.mousePosition;
				}
			}
		}

		if(Input.GetButtonDown("Fire1")){
			// rotating flag
			_isRotating = true;
			
			// store mouse
			pastPos = Input.mousePosition;
		}
		
		if(Input.GetButtonUp("Fire1")){
			// rotating flag
			_isRotating = false;
		}
	}
}
```

After much trial and error, our Atlas was finally rotating.
